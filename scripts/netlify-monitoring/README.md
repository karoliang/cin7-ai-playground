## 🛠️ Installation

The monitoring tools are already integrated into your project's npm scripts. Make sure you have:

1. Netlify CLI installed globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Netlify CLI configured with your access token (already done)

## 📋 Available Scripts

npm run netlify:monitor

# Show current monitoring status without starting monitoring
npm run netlify:monitor:status
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring (30-second intervals)
npm run netlify:monitor:continuous

# Start continuous monitoring with custom interval (60 seconds)
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --interval 60

# Start with custom alert threshold (5 consecutive failures)
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --threshold 5
```

### Error Management

```bash
# Analyze recent errors and attempt automated fixes
npm run netlify:fix-errors

# Fix errors and run type check afterward
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/error-fixer.js --run-type-check
```

### Deployment and Monitoring

```bash
# Trigger new deployment and monitor it
npm run netlify:deploy-and-monitor
```

## 📊 Monitoring Features

### Error Categories

The system categorizes deployment errors into:

- **TypeScript Errors**: TS compilation issues, type mismatches, missing properties
- **Build Script Errors**: npm build failures, exit code errors
- **Dependency Issues**: Missing packages, version conflicts
- **Permission Errors**: Authentication, access token issues
- **Unknown**: Other deployment issues

### Automated Fixes

The system can automatically fix:

- Missing `as` props on Text components
- Missing `autoComplete` props on TextField components
- Deprecated Card.Section usage
- Stack component import issues
- Polaris v13 compatibility issues
- Common type mismatches

### Alerting

Continuous monitoring provides:

- Real-time deployment status updates
- Consecutive failure alerts
- Critical failure notifications
- Success confirmations
- Detailed error analysis

## 📈 Monitoring Data

The system maintains several monitoring files:

- `.netlify-monitoring.json` - Main monitoring data and statistics
- `.netlify-error-log.json` - Detailed error logs
- `.netlify-success-log.json` - Successful deployment logs
- `.netlify-alerts.json` - Alert history

## 🔧 Configuration

The monitoring system is pre-configured with:

- **Site ID**: `8d4a4beb-f0be-4b93-8eab-ed295d675415`
- **Access Token**: Configured and validated
- **Default Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Alert Threshold**: 3 consecutive failures

## 📋 Usage Examples

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Run basic monitoring after each major change
- Use continuous monitoring during development sprints
- Check status before releases

### 2. Error Management

- Run error fixer after failed deployments
- Review automated fixes before committing
- Test fixes locally with `npm run type-check`

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

- Use appropriate intervals (30-60 seconds)
- Set sensible alert thresholds (3-5 failures)
- Monitor during deployment windows

### 4. Data Management

- Review monitoring logs weekly
- Clean up old log files monthly
- Track error patterns over time

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication Errors**
   - Verify Netlify CLI is configured: `netlify status`
   - Check access token validity
   - Ensure site permissions are correct

2. **Missing Monitoring Files**
   - Files are created automatically on first run
   - Check file permissions in project directory

3. **Continuous Monitoring Stops**
   - Check system resources
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review error logs in `.netlify-alerts.json`

4. **Automated Fixes Don't Work**
   - Some fixes require manual intervention
   - Check file permissions
   - Review fix patterns in error-fixer.js

### Getting Help

For issues with the monitoring system:

1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Review the monitoring data files for detailed information
3. Verify Netlify CLI configuration
4. Ensure the project has proper build setup

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Monitoring Intervals

```bash
# Check every 2 minutes
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --interval 120

# Check every 5 minutes
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --interval 300
```

### Custom Alert Thresholds

```bash
# Alert after 5 consecutive failures
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --threshold 5

# Alert after 10 consecutive failures
node scripts/netlify-monitoring/continuous-monitor.js --threshold 10
```

### Manual API Calls

You can also make direct API calls using Netlify CLI:

```bash
# Get site information
netlify api getSite --data '{ "site_id": "8d4a4beb-f0be-4b93-8eab-ed295d675415" }'

# Get recent deployments
netlify api listSiteDeploys --data '{ "site_id": "8d4a4beb-f0be-4b93-8eab-ed295d675415", "per_page": 10 }'
```

## 🔄 Integration with CI/CD

These monitoring tools can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Monitor Deployment
  run: |
    npm run netlify:deploy-and-monitor
    npm run netlify:fix-errors
    npm run type-check
```

## 📊 Metrics and Analytics

The system tracks:

- Total deployments over time
- Success/failure rates
- Common error patterns
- Consecutive failure streaks
- Time between deployments
- Error fix effectiveness

Use this data to:

- Identify problematic code patterns
- Optimize build processes
- Plan deployment schedules
- Improve code quality
