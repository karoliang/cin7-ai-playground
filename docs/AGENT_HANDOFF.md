## Handoff to Dev Agent

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Story Creation**: Break down Phase 1 epics into actionable user stories
2. **Development Planning**: Create sprint plans and task breakdowns
3. **Environment Setup**: Initialize development environment and tooling
4. **Team Coordination**: Assign tasks and establish development workflows

### Phase 1 Focus Areas (Months 1-3)
1. **Multi-tenant Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Database setup with RLS policies
   - Authentication system with @cin7.com restriction
   - Basic project CRUD operations

2. **User Management** (Weeks 3-4)
   - User registration and profile management
   - Tenant membership system
   - Role-based access control

3. **Project Management** (Weeks 5-6)
   - Project creation and management UI
   - File upload/download system
   - Basic code editor integration

4. **UI Framework** (Weeks 7-8)
   - React + TypeScript setup
   - Responsive design with Polaris
   - Navigation and error handling

### Development Guidelines
- **Code Quality**: Follow the comprehensive quality strategy document
- **Security**: Implement all RLS policies and security measures
- **Testing**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage throughout development
- **Documentation**: Keep technical documentation updated

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
- Multi-tenant data isolation verified
- User authentication system functional
- Project CRUD operations working
- File management system operational
- 80%+ test coverage achieved
- Security audit passed

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Multi-tenant**: Row-level security for complete data isolation
- **Real-time**: WebSocket infrastructure with operational transformation
- **AI Integration**: GLM API with contextual prompting
- **Security**: @cin7.com domain restriction with enterprise features

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + Polaris
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **AI**: GLM API integration
- **Hosting**: Netlify Standard + Supabase Pro
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phased Rollout**: 4 phases over 12 months
- **Internal Focus**: @cin7.com users only
- **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing and security review
- **Collaborative**: Real-time multi-user development

## Risk Mitigation Summary

### Technical Risks Addressed
