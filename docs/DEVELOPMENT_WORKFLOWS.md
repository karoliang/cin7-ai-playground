## Task Management and Prioritization

### Story Point Estimation

**Fibonacci Sequence**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

**Definition of Points**:
```yaml
1 Point: Simple task (1-2 hours)
  - Well-understood requirements
  - Minimal complexity
  - Low risk
  - Example: Update existing UI component

2 Points: Moderate task (3-4 hours)
  - Clear requirements
  - Some complexity
  - Low to moderate risk
  - Example: Add new API endpoint

3 Points: Complex task (5-8 hours)
  - Some requirements uncertainty
  - Moderate complexity
  - Moderate risk
  - Example: Implement user authentication flow

5 Points: Very complex task (1-2 days)
  - Significant requirements discovery
  - High complexity
  - High risk
  - Example: Implement multi-tenant database migration

8 Points: Epic task (3-5 days)
  - Major requirements discovery
  - Very high complexity
  - Very high risk
  - Example: Complete authentication system implementation

13 Points: Research/Spikes (1 week)
  - Unknown requirements
  - Research needed
  - High uncertainty
  - Example: Evaluate real-time collaboration technologies
```

### Prioritization Framework

#### ICE Score Method

**ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease**

**Impact (1-10)**:
- How much value does this deliver to users?
- How much does this contribute to sprint goals?
- How critical is this to the overall project?

**Confidence (1-10)**:
- How confident are we in the requirements?
- How certain are we about the technical approach?
- How much risk is involved?

**Ease (1-10)**:
- How much effort is required? (inverted scale - higher = easier)
- How complex is the implementation?
- How many dependencies are involved?

**Example Scoring**:
```yaml
Task: Implement RLS policies for projects table
Impact: 10 (Critical for security)
Confidence: 8 (Clear requirements, proven approach)
Ease: 7 (Moderate complexity, few dependencies)
ICE Score: 10 × 8 × 7 = 560

Task: Create tenant management UI
Impact: 8 (High user value)
Confidence: 9 (Clear requirements, standard patterns)
Ease: 8 (Low complexity, no dependencies)
ICE Score: 8 × 9 × 8 = 576
```

#### Sprint Prioritization Rules

1. **Sprint Goal First**: Tasks that directly contribute to sprint goal
2. **Dependencies**: Unblock other team members' work
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk items early
4. **Quality Gates**: Ensure testing and quality requirements are met
5. **Definition of Done**: All tasks must meet DoD criteria
