# Project Brief: CIN7 AI Playground Evolution

## Executive Summary

CIN7 AI Playground Evolution represents a strategic transformation from an internal AI-powered code generation tool into a comprehensive collaborative development platform. This evolution will enhance contextual prompting capabilities, integrate DSL component libraries, establish multi-user collaboration infrastructure, and create seamless workflows between Jira requirements and AI-generated solutions. The platform will serve all CIN7 employees (@cin7.com) with advanced features including real-time collaboration, automatic staging environments, version control integration, and comprehensive notification systems, positioning CIN7 at the forefront of AI-powered internal development tools.

## Problem Statement

The current CIN7 AI Playground, while functional for individual AI code generation, suffers from several critical limitations that hinder organizational productivity and collaboration:

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Single-User Limitation**: Only one user can work on a project at a time, preventing team collaboration
- **Basic Prompting**: Lacks contextual awareness of business requirements and project constraints
- **Manual Workflow**: Requires manual Git operations, staging URL creation, and project management
- **No Integration**: Disconnected from Jira epics, Figma designs, and existing development workflows
- **Limited Learning**: AI cannot learn from organization's design patterns and code libraries
- **Access Control**: Basic @cin7.com restriction without granular permissions or project isolation

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced team collaboration efficiency
- Inconsistent code quality across projects
- Lost productivity from manual workflow management
- Missed opportunities for organizational learning and knowledge sharing
- Inability to scale AI-powered development across teams

The urgency for this transformation is driven by increasing demand for AI-assisted development across CIN7 teams and the competitive advantage that superior internal development tools provide.
